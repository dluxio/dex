## Features we'd like to incentivize:

* A feature to incentivize features: Idea's manifest by means of interest
* Progress indication for tasks.
* Navmesh export function: Currently we have an issue where the collaborative models that represent our avatars block out walkable geometry when building the nav mesh from AI. The solution will be to remove entities id'd player and naf-* (networked avatars). Must modify original plugin and then pipe output to our IPFS gateway.
* Image ratio resize: OpenGL runs with textures at pow2 (2,4,8,16,32...), we'd like to have drag and dropped photos resized down to the next pow2 size to lighten both storage and processing loads. while doing this the aspect ratio should be preserved and the entity generated should have a matching aspect ratio.
* Save components from inspector: Watcher only looks for position, rotation, and scale. We would like to save all component changes as well, such as geometry, material, model, etc... Adding user generated functions from the JS and allowing team members easy GUI access to all the functionality that can be built under the hood.
* Asset manager: View all assets uploaded and control IPFS pinning. Ability to add asset to scene, with geometry selection, and ability to set featured image for blog and 360 portal. We can and should include this on an account basis with and overall knowledge of who is paying to pin what to minimize costs. This can be done via our side-chain that is currently pinning content via @rtrade
